## Innovative Idea
Our team idea is a platform for students to look for people to collab on a tech project. Users will post a tech project idea or an existing project that needs more functionalities. Users can attach images, sketches, or video demos of the projects, and others will comment under the post if they want to collab or have any suggestions for the project. Users can also rate the tech projects by uniqueness or best features. The author of the post can invite people in the comment section to a room for further discussion, where we will provide a live whiteboard and a chat section for them to draw out diagrams and discuss ideas. The whiteboard will have functionalities like hand drawing, dragging and dropping shapes, erasing things, and inserting and annotating images. Our application will also show the top 5 tech ideas of the day every day, ranked by the most upvotes for uniqueness and cool features. Users can customize their profile with the tech stack they like, and our application will recommend tech projects suitable to users’ profiles, or users can search for a tech project by tags if they don’t like our recommendation.

Our idea takes inspiration from LinkedIn, but instead of helping people looking for jobs or companies looking for employees, our application aims to connect students who wants to collaborate on an existing project, or inspire students to come up with a tech project idea by viewing the top projects of the day. We also provide the tools like the real-time white board which we believe will faciliate the brainstorming process between students.


## Important Components

The identifying functionality for our website is the collaboration room. Up to five people can be put into a room where they can all write on a whiteboard and communicate through a live chat. The whiteboard will offer tools that allows the users to draw, insert and modify simple shapes, add text, and images. The UI will also include a search bar that users can use to search popular Github repositories for ideas. We will include a sample preview of a repository's README.md for the users to quickly read through. Users will be able to filter through ideas with tags and sort by stars.

There will also be a forum page for users to post their ideas and look for other people to collaborate with. Every post with have the option to be upvoted and commented on. Authors of posts can then add users in the comment session to a private room dedicated to the post. We will save each user's posts and room sessions.
