# Database

# URL Routes / Mappings

# Authentication
Passwords are encrypted using SHA256 (1-way encryption). During login we encrypt the string and compare it with the password stored in the database (this password is already encrypted). You can see this in ```modal.js```:

```javascript
const hashPassword = await sha256(password, 12)
const correctPass = hashPassword === user[0].password;
```

## Authorization
- You can only use some features if you are already login (authenticated)

In the following example, you only have the option to "create post" once you're logged in:
