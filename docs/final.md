# URL Routes / Mappings
| URL Path          | Description      | Authentication |
| ------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| `/` | Landing page | not required
| `/feed` | Feed page | not required but some features are restricted to only login users (see [below](#authorization))
| `/project?=...` | Each project has its own page | not required but some features are restricted to only login users
| `/canvas?=...` | Each project has its own canvas page | not required but some features are restricted to only login users
| `/profile?=...` | Other users profile | required
| `/dashboard` | Users own profile | required


# Authentication
Passwords are encrypted using SHA256 (1-way encryption). During login we encrypt the string and compare it with the password stored in the database (this password is already encrypted). You can see this in ```modal.js```:

```javascript
const hashPassword = await sha256(password, 12)
const correctPass = hashPassword === user[0].password;
```

## Authorization
- You can only use some features if you are already login (authenticated)

In the following example, you only have the option to "create post" once you're logged in:
<img src="../demos/final/authorization_example.gif">

Some features that require authentication first:
- Create post (in feed page)
- Visit other users profile (in profile page)
- Visit your own profile (in account page)
- See chat and interact in chat (in canvas page)
- Manage projects (in account page)

Refer to [this section](#url-routes--mappings) for more information on which page requires authentication
