# Team Alef (â„µ)
Application name: <a href="https://cs326project.herokuapp.com/">KanvasWire</a>

Semester: Fall 2022

# Overview
KanvasWire is a platform that enable users to post their project ideas to collaborate with like-minded individuals. KanvasWire offers a variety of services for collaboration such as: a comment section for discussion, an interactive canvas to illustrate their ideas, and a chat to communicate with collaborators. The novelty of our platform comes in the form of combining those services together into one innovative product. Our platform's target audience are people with a STEM and tech background and we made sure to address their needs through our website. For instance, we implemented a chat feature to enable users to send equations using LaTeX as we believe this would improve communication and enhance productivity. You can try out KanvasWire [here](https://cs326project.herokuapp.com/) or through the url: [https://cs326project.herokuapp.com/](https://cs326project.herokuapp.com/).

# URL Routes / Mappings
| URL Path          | Description      | Authentication |
| ------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| `/` | Landing page | not required
| `/feed` | Feed page | not required but some features are restricted to only login users (see [below](#authorization))
| `/project?=...` | Each project has its own page | not required but some features are restricted to only login users
| `/canvas?=...` | Each project has its own canvas page | not required but some features are restricted to only login users
| `/profile?=...` | Other users profile | required
| `/dashboard` | Users own profile | required


# Authentication
Passwords are encrypted using Bcrypt library (1-way encryption). During login we encrypt the string and compare it with the password stored in the database (this password is already encrypted). You can see this in ```/routes/user.js```:

```javascript
const isMatch = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password);
if (!isMatch){
    ...
}
```
Once the user logins, we use the `jsonwebtoken` library to create a JSON web token that we can use to create a login session for the user
```javascript
jwt.sign(
    payload,
    "randomString",
    {
        expiresIn: 3600
    },
    (err, token) => {
        if (err) throw err;
        res.status(200).json({
        token
        });
    }
);
```

To authenticate we can verify using the JSON web token
```javascript
jwt.verify(token, "randomString");
```

## Authorization
- You can only use some features if you are already login (authenticated)

In the following example, you only have the option to "create post" once you're logged in:
<img src="../demos/final/authorization_example.gif">

Some features that require authentication first:
- Create post (in feed page)
- Liking a post (in feed page)
- Wont be redirected to a project page (in feed page) but can still access a project if given a URL
- No button to redirect to Kanvas page (in feed page) but can still access a project if given a URL
- Visit other users profile (in profile page)
- Visit your own profile (in account page)
- See chat and interact in chat (in canvas page)
- Manage projects (in account page)

Refer to [this section](#url-routes--mappings) for more information on which page requires authentication

## Existing accounts
For testing purposes we provide the following list of account and password for testing:

# Division of Labor

Peter Phan: feed page, project page, dashboard, backend, API endpoints, CRUD, fake data generation, database design, database implementation, frontend (bootstrap), routing, code refactoring, code organization, built in-house template engine, authentication, authorization, deployment

Hieu Nguyen: feed page, project page, account page (statistics / graphs), canvas page (notification), backend, API endpoints, Github API, CRUD, database design, database implementation, frontend (using JS libraries), query-builder helper, deployment

Phat Nguyen (Peter): canvas page (canvas + chat), landing page, feed page, frontend, backend (implemented API), database design, password encryption, milestone docs, deployment

We all contributed equally at each milestone. But of course everyone's priorities and strengths were different so we contributed to different aspects of the website in an optimal way.

# Conclusion

This assignment gave us an opportunity to learn how to develop a website from start to finish in a team environment. Some of the things that we learned include: routing, API endpoints, and deployment. Some technologies we learned include: socket.io and bootstrap.

One of the major difficulties we faced was with routing with dynamically generated content. We found this process challenging when we realized our routing implementation was not set up correctly. As a result, we had to reorganize a large part of our code-base and this took a lot of time. If there is something we would like to know prior to starting this project, was that we would prioritize more time in designing the routing of the project. We did this half-way through the project but ideally we want to think about this at the very start. Lastly, another difficulty was with deploying to Heroku. Our heroku code require some changes for it to work: such as the socket.io URL.
