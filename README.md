# CS326 Project (Team Alef - â„µ)
KanvasWire is a platform that enable users to post their project ideas to collaborate with like-minded individuals. KanvasWire offers a variety of services for collaboration such as: a comment section for discussion, an interactive canvas to illustrate their ideas, and a chat to communicate with collaborators. The novelty of our platform comes in the form of combining those services together into one innovative product. Our platform's target audience are people with a STEM and tech background and we made sure to address their needs through our website. For instance, we implemented a chat feature to enable users to send equations using LaTeX as we believe this would improve communication and enhance productivity. You can try out KanvasWire [here](https://cs326project.herokuapp.com/) or through the url: [https://cs326project.herokuapp.com/](https://cs326project.herokuapp.com/).
